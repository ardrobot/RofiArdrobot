ROFI Ardrobot Mod
=================
Port of the awesome ROFI (http://www.projectbiped.com/prototypes/rofi) biped robot project to use with Ardrobot.  This is very early work in progress.

OpenSCAD
--------
I'm in the process of converting the ROFI body that was designed in Blender into OpenSCAD so we can easily update settings for new phones/tablets on the fly.
